# Jojos-Website
This is a website that i made with Anthony Kalbe in duo for school between march and april 2020.
Our main reference was jojo.fandom.com. I made the OST, Auteur, pop-culture and Histoire de l'oeuvre parts, and we both made the Accueil. Anthony made the other parts, however i remade some of his parts and the Accueil to accords them better with the rest of the site. I especially remade the Accueil, Résumé and Personnages CSS.
